# MFM-Inv-Ga
I provide MFM-Inv-Ga and MFM-Ga R code in this repository. This repository has the following function files.    
  **'IG-functions.R'**: a function file for Gibbs samplers in MFM-Inv-Ga for cluster analysis and density estimation
  **'Ga-functions.R'**: a function file for Gibbs samplers in MFM-Ga for cluster analysis and density estimation
  **'IG_functions_network.R'**: a function file for Gibbs samplers in MFM-Inv-Ga for community detection
  **'Ga_functions_network.R'**: a function file for Gibbs samplers in MFM-Ga for community detection
  **'density_output.R'**: function file for MCMC summary of density estimation 

This repositoru has the following files for one shot example.
  -'cluster_analysis.R' : cluster analysis with MFM-Inv-Ga and MFM-Ga
  -'density_estimate_galaxy' : density estimation for galaxy data with MFM-Inv-Ga and MFM-Ga
  -'community_detection.R' : community detection with MFM-Inv-Ga and MFM-Ga
